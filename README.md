1. quick_sort_test.cpp: sorting an array in increase order using quick sort algorithm.
The key is divide the array into left and right array, and find the right position of the first element in the original array.

2. merge_sort.cpp: sorting an array in ascending order using merge sort algorithm
They key is divide the array evenly into 2. Then keep dividing until there is 1 element left.
Then the merge will merge 2 arrays into big array by comparing each element in two subarray.
Then put the smallest one into main array.
